### React tools used

React is the JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React Router handles the routing within the page. CSS is what I used to style all the pages. The inline styling was mostly used for the background images. JSON server is the restful API for managing data.

### How to view in your environment.

3. Start the server with npm start.
